\abstract{ We suggest a novel approach for coupled computations of conjugate heat transfer, considering the exchange of the boundary conditions between fluid and solid solver.
Many engineering design processes require to predict temperature distributions, e.g. the life of a turbine blade reduces by half with an increased metal temperature of 30 Kelvin [1].  In case of a complex flow field, the temperature prediction is improved if the fluid and solid temperature computations are coupled. Besides the need for two different solvers, the challenge arises through the different time scales in the solid and the fluid that can vary by orders of magnitude and increase the computational cost. 
Within the multi-physics environment COOLFluiD 3, developed at the von Kármán Institute for Fluid Dynamics, we included four different coupling strategies. In all methods, boundary conditions are exchanged until equal temperatures and heat fluxes at the interface from the solid to the fluid domain. The first method sets a temperature distribution to the fluid solver that predicts a heat flux distribution imposed to the solid solver [2]. The second method sets a heat flux distribution to the fluid solver computing a temperature field for the solid [3]. A third method imposes a temperature field to the fluid returning a Robin boundary condition to the solid using the wall heat transfer equation [4]. Based on a stability analysis for the existing coupling procedures [5], we postulated a new method, imposing a heat flux distribution to the fluid solver that returns a Robin boundary condition to the solid solver [6]. The stability of all methods only depend on the dimensionless Biot number, the ratio of conductive to convective thermal resistance.
For flat plate computations, the result of each method is in good agreement with an analytical solution. We compare the novel coupling strategy with the established methods. Considering the stability, the new approach is advantageous, especially for high Biot numbers. Further, it converges faster concluding that it can improve efficiency and accuracy of conjugate heat transfer computations.

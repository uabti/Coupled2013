\section{NUMERICAL METHOD AND COUPLING PROCEDURES}

The flow equations are solved by means of the second order accurate Pressure Stabilized Petrov Galerkin Finite Element method with the Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin stabilization. The time is integrated with the Crank-Nicholson scheme, of second order accuracy.
The convective terms are linearized in time.
The solid conduction is solved with the steady state Finite Element Method.

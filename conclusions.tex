\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\begin{itemize}
\item found a stability criterion for cht computations
\item confirm the stability criterion, dependence on Biot number by validation flat plate test case
\item influence of Navier-Stokes computations per iteration
\item one coupling procedure (hFTB) does not converge as the others
\item flux back methods converge faster for many Navier-Stokes solves per iteration
\item suggest a novel coupling procedure
\end{itemize}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
Many engineering design processes require to predict temperature distributions, e.g. the life of a turbine blade reduces by half with an increased metal temperature of 30 Kelvin \cite{Han}.  In case of a complex flow field, the temperature prediction is improved if the fluid and solid temperature computations are coupled. Besides the need for two different solvers, the challenge arises through the different time scales in the solid and the fluid that can vary by orders of magnitude and increase the computational cost.

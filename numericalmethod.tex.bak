\section{NUMERICAL METHOD AND COUPLING PROCEDURES}

The flow equations are solved by the second order accurate Pressure Stabilized Petrov Galerkin Finite Element method with a Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin stabilization. The time is integrated with the second order accurate Crank-Nicholson scheme.
The convective terms are linearized in time as described in [?].
The solid conduction is solved with a steady state Finite Element Method.
Many problems need to compute fluid and solid part simultaneously taking the influence of one domain on the other into account, which we call a conjugate problem. There are two main approaches to solve a conjugate problem. A monolithic approach with one solver for both domains and a coupled approach with different solvers for each domains.  
Besides the monolithic approach there are different partioned approaches as we detailed in \cite{Verstraete2008} and summarize in the next sections.

The flux forward temperature back method (FFTB, named from the perspective of the fluid domain) imposes a wall temperature distribution to the fluid solver. After the fluid calculation the resulting heat flux distribution is imposed to the solid conduction solver, which returns an updated temperature in turn imposed to the fluid domain. The exchange of boundary conditions is repeated until continuous temperatures and heat fluxes between both domains.
